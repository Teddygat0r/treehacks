Abstract
The growing gap between the increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) and the limited computational budgets of
edge devices poses a key challenge for efficient on-device inference,
despite gradual improvements in hardware capabilities. Existing
strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost
burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that
leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a
decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of
LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices.
We propose SLED, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft
models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency
of verification, the edge server batches the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports heterogeneous devices
and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing a single upstream target model across devices. Our initial experiments with
Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped
with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: ×2.2 higher
system throughput, ×2.8 higher system capacity, and better cost
efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.

1 Introduction
LLMs have revolutionized various domains, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and
complex reasoning [1]. Their widespread adoption has led to transformative applications in areas such as intelligent chatbots, content
creation, code generation, and scientific discovery. However, the
immense memory and compute footprint associated with state-ofthe-art LLMs, often comprising billions or even trillions of parameters, pose significant challenges for deployment. These models
typically demand powerful accelerators like GPUs and substantial
memory, limiting their direct execution on resource-constrained
devices. Deploying LLMs at the edge, closer to data sources and
end-users, offers significant advantages including reduced latency,
enhanced privacy, and lower bandwidth consumption[2]. Nevertheless, edge environments, characterized by limited memory, processing power, and energy budgets, present formidable obstacles to
efficient LLM inference. Existing strategies to address these limitations include aggressive model compression techniques such as
quantization [16, 32], pruning[19, 22], and knowledge distillation
[10]. Other approaches involve distributed inference, where model

layers are partitioned across multiple devices or between edge and
cloud[29, 33], or full remote inference, where the entire computation is offloaded to a powerful central server[7, 31]. While these
methods show some potential, they often come with trade-offs:
compression can sacrifice model accuracy, distributed inference
introduces synchronization overheads and is incompatible with heterogeneous edge devices, and remote inference negates the benefits
of edge deployment, incurring non-negligible costs.
Speculative decoding [15] is a decoding acceleration technique
that first generates multiple draft tokens using a relatively small
draft model and then verifies them in a single forward pass using a
larger, more accurate target model. By generating multiple tokens
with the smaller model and validating them in a single pass on
the larger model, speculative decoding significantly reduces the
number of forward passes required on the large model, thereby
accelerating the decoding process. This position paper introduces
SLED, shown in Fig. 1, a novel approach that re-imagines speculative decoding as a paradigm specifically tailored for efficient LLM
inference at the edge, by intelligently orchestrating computation
across heterogeneous devices. Within the defined service area consisting of an edge server and multiple heterogeneous edge devices,
and each edge device is equipped with its own lightweight LLMs
scaled according to individual computational and memory resource
capacities. These edge devices are responsible for serving diverse
LLM-based applications such as intelligent personal assistants, text
generation, and semantic analysis, among other tasks. Concurrently,
a single, shared edge server, equipped with a more precise target
model, efficiently batches and verifies these drafted tokens.
The advantages of the SLED are threefold:
(1) Compared with inference solely on the edge device, the SLED
improves the quality of response on the device by leveraging
a larger target model on the server to verify draft tokens.
(2) Compared with inference solely on the edge server, SLED
reduces the monetary cost for edge users by limiting their
use of server resources, requiring only token verification
rather than full generation.

(3) It utilizes the computational resource of edge server to verified batched draft tokens from devices, rather than generate
all tokens solely, enabling edge server support more edge
devices simultaneously.
We compare the system capacity, the number of edge devices
supported by the system, of SLED and a centralized serving system
with the same response rate but different device types. From Tab. 1,
we observe that compared with a centralized LLM serving system
for the edge, the proposed SLED is capable of increasing the system
capacity by 2.6 to 2.9 times.
Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose SLED, a novel speculative decoding framework
specifically designed for heterogeneous edge computing environments by batching the verification requests from varying draft models on the server, enabling efficient LLM inference without accuracy degradation.
• In SLED, we propose and deploy the dynamic drafting scheme
on edge devices. By dynamically requesting for verification
according to the confidence score of the draft model, the edge
devices can avoid unnecessary verification, hence reducing
the communication rounds and improving the utilization of
the server.
• We demonstrate through preliminary evaluation the substantial benefits of SLED in terms of ×2.2 more system throughput, ×2.8 more system capacity, and better cost-efficiency on
diverse edge hardware.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section
2 reviews existing work in LLM inference for edge computing.
Section 3 details the architectural design and key components of
SLED. Section 4 presents our experimental setup and discusses
the evaluation results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and
outlines future research directions.

offloading paradigms.
2.1 Model Compression and Lightweight
Architectures
To enable LLMs to run on resource-constrained devices, significant
efforts have been directed towards model compression. Quantization reduces the numerical precision of model parameters and activations to decrease memory footprint and accelerate computation

[4, 16, 17]. Pruning identifies and removes redundant connections
or neurons from the neural network without significant performance loss, resulting in sparser and smaller models [9]. Knowledge
distillation involves training a smaller "student" model to mimic the
behavior of a larger "teacher" model, thereby transferring knowledge and achieving comparable performance with a significantly
smaller footprint [10]. Beyond these optimization techniques, research has also focused on designing inherently lightweight transformer architectures that are more efficient from the ground up,
such as MobileBERT [23], Mamba [8] or other compact variants,
often by optimizing attention mechanisms or reducing the number
of layers and hidden dimensions. Recent efforts, such as EdgeLLM
[27], have explored speculative decoding for on-device inference by
introducing compute-efficient branch navigation and adaptive fallback strategies to reduce resource demands. However, co-locating
both draft and target models on edge devices further strains limited
resources, and the output quality remains constrained by the size of
the deployable target model. Despite their advantages in reducing
model size and computational demands, a common limitation of
these model compression techniques is the inherent trade-off with
model quality: aggressive compression often leads to a measurable
decrease in accuracy compared to their full-sized counterparts.
2.2 Edge-Cloud/Server Offloading and
Distributed Inference
Another line of research focuses on distributing LLM computation
across multiple devices or partitioning tasks between edge and
cloud/server infrastructure. Model partitioning schemes divide a
large LLM into smaller sub-models, with different parts executed
on different devices [28, 29, 33]. For example, EdgeShard[33] partitioned LLM into shards and deploy on distributed devices to benefit
from the collaboration among edge devices and cloud server. This
often involves pipeline parallelism or tensor parallelism techniques,
where different stages or segments of the model’s computation are
assigned to different devices. While this allows larger models to
run on resource-constrained setups, it introduces communication
overheads and synchronization challenges, particularly for heterogeneous hardware and varying network conditions. Edge-cloud
offloading dynamically decides which parts of the inference task
should be performed locally at the edge and which should be offloaded to a more powerful cloud server, often based on real-time
resource availability, network bandwidth, and latency requirements
[33]. These methods aim to balance the benefits of edge processing with the computational power of the cloud, but often require
sophisticated orchestration and robust connectivity.
2.3 Pure Remote Inference
Pure remote inference, where the entire LLM resides on centralized
data-center GPUs, represents a prevalent deployment paradigm
due to its simplicity and centralized resource utilization. Recent
research primarily focuses on resource efficiency and latency optimization. Kwon et al.[14] proposed vLLM with a PagedAttention
allocator, significantly reducing KV-cache overhead and fragmentation, achieving up to 4× throughput improvement. Wu et al. [26]
introduced FastServe, leveraging multi-level feedback queue scheduling and proactive KV-cache management to reduce tail latency by
up to 31× at the 99th percentile. Rajbhandari et al. [21] developed
DeepSpeed Inference, combining multiple parallelism strategies
with NVMe and CPU off-loading, allowing inference of substantially larger models and reducing latency by up to 7.3×. Crucially,
the standard decoding process in remote inference is often autoregressive, generating one token at a time, which can be memoryintensive due to large key-value caches and lead to resource underutilization on powerful servers. Moreover, the cost associated with
cloud GPU instances for continuous, often under-utilized, inference also presents a substantial economic burden, especially for
high-throughput scenarios.
Table 2 compares the SLED and related works that deliver LLM
inference service or propose model variants for edge devices, among
which SLED stands out as the only approach that enables lossless
LLM inference for heterogeneous edge devices, while maintaining
a collaborative design that can flexibly accommodate increasingly
large models. SLED directly addresses these limitations by fundamentally altering the inference paradigm. Instead of autoregressive
token generation on the powerful central server, SLED offloads the
preliminary token drafting to lightweight edge devices. This allows
the central server to focus its considerable resources primarily on
the more efficient and batchable task of verifying multiple drafted
tokens. By doing so, SLED significantly improves the utilization
of expensive server-side GPU resources without sacrificing model
accuracy, leading to a more cost-effective and scalable distributed
LLM inference system.
3 SLED Design
3.1 Speculative Decoding
SLED adopts speculative decoding[15], a recently proposed paradigm that leverages a lightweight draft model to generate multiple
tokens. Instead of waiting for a single token from the large target
model at each step, the draft model speculatively predicts a candidate sequence, which is then selectively verified or corrected by
the more accurate but slower target model with one single forwarding. This design decouples the fast-path token generation from the
slow-path verification, enabling improved throughput and reduced
end-to-end latency without compromising output quality. In SLED,

this speculative execution is further optimized for edge-server deployment under variable connectivity and resource constraints.
According to the original work on speculative decoding[15], a
draft token 𝑥˜𝑛+1 is sampled from the draft model’s output distribution 𝑝(𝑥 | 𝑥1, 𝑥2, · · · , 𝑥𝑛). This draft token is then accepted with
probability:
𝛼 = min
1,
𝑝target(𝑥˜𝑛+1 | 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛)
𝑝draft(𝑥˜𝑛+1 | 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛)

, (1)
where 𝑝targetis the distribution given by the large target model,
and 𝑝draft is that of the smaller draft model. Tokens that fail this
acceptance criterion are resampled directly from 𝑝target − 𝑝draft. As
a result, the generated sequence strictly follows the target model’s
distribution, ensuring no degradation in accuracy compared with
standard autoregressive decoding.
3.2 System Overview
Fig. 2 shows the detailed structure and data flow of the SLED. In
close proximity to 𝑁 edge devices, typically located at facilities
such as base stations, the edge server provides substantial computational capabilities, leveraging specialized hardware like Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs) or Neural Processing Units (NPUs). On
this edge server, a single, comprehensive target model is deployed,
optimized for efficiently verifying the draft tokens generated by
the distributed edge devices.
Operationally, user-generated prompts, encompassing a wide
array of task-specific requests, are initially received and tokenized
locally by each edge device. Subsequently, the tokenized prompts,
denoted as input sequences 𝑝
𝑛 where 𝑛 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 𝑁}, are processed by local draft models to generate speculative tokens. These
draft tokens are then transmitted to the edge server for verification.
Upon completion of the verification step, the edge server communicates the results back to the respective edge devices, specifically
identifying rejected token positions along with any necessary corrective tokens.
This drafting-verification workflow iteratively progresses, alternating between local speculation at the edge devices and centralized
validation at the edge server, until the generated output reaches
the predetermined desired length or the end-of-response token
is encountered. This collaborative mechanism not only optimizes
resource utilization by distributing computational tasks according
to device capabilities but also significantly reduces latency and enhances overall efficiency by transmitting tokens rather than huge
activations.
3.3 Dynamic Drafting on Edge Devices
On edge devices, each verification cycle is preceded by the generation of multiple draft tokens. The acceptance rate of these draft
tokens serves as a crucial indicator of their quality, directly influenced by the capabilities of the draft models utilized. A higher
acceptance rate is desirable as it signifies fewer verification iterations and consequently reduces the computational burden on the
costly target model, thereby mitigating communication overhead
inherent in edge computing scenarios.
Previous studies [11], validated by our preliminary experimental
results, have established a correlation between the acceptance rate
of draft tokens and their associated confidence scores derived from
the output logits. As illustrated in Fig.3, draft tokens with higher
confidence scores exhibit a significantly increased likelihood of
acceptance by the target model.
Building upon this insight, we propose and implement a dynamic
drafting mechanism on edge devices. This adaptive strategy modulates the speculative decoding length based on the real-time evaluation of token confidence scores. Formally, we introduce a threshold
parameter, 𝑐𝑡ℎ, derived empirically, and define the decision-making
process for triggering server verification for the draft tokens as
follows:

Considering the inherent unreliability and fluctuating nature
of network conditions in edge computing environments, such as
variable round-trip time (RTT) and intermittent connectivity, we
further enhance our system with an asynchronous decoding mechanism accompanied by a timeout protocol. Specifically, edge devices
continue generating additional draft tokens using local lightweight
LLM concurrently while awaiting verification responses from the
edge server. If a verification response confirms acceptance of all previously sent draft tokens, these locally generated tokens seamlessly
transition into the draft token queue for subsequent verification
cycles, thus significantly reducing idle wait times.
Additionally, each verification request initiates a timer on the device side. If the verification response exceeds the timer due to server
failures or network disruptions, the most recently-produced draft
tokens are concatenated with existing draft tokens for subsequent
verification attempts. To maintain continuity of user experience, the
draft tokens generated during this period are released to users as a
fallback when consecutive verification failures exceed the threshold.
3.4 Batched Verification on Edge Server
The edge server aggregates verification requests from multiple
edge devices into batches to optimize computational efficiency and
throughput. Our current implementation within SLED employs a
static batching strategy. Under this scheme, incoming verification
requests are temporarily queued until reaching a fixed batch size.
Subsequently, a batch planner retrieves the queued requests, applies
appropriate padding to equalize token lengths, and forwards the
consolidated batch to the target LLM for verification.
A critical advantage of SLED lies in the target model’s ability
to accept and verify draft tokens generated by diverse draft LLMs
across heterogeneous edge devices provided that all edge devices
share the same tokenizer. This compatibility effectively mitigates
device heterogeneity, enabling each device to select a draft model
suited to its computational constraints while ensuring scalable and
efficient inference across a wide range of edge hardware.

LLM serving systems, highlighting improved scalability of
the SLED framework.
4 Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate the performance and efficiency of the
proposed SLED framework through extensive simulations and measurements. We assess SLED’s efficacy compared to a centralized
LLM serving system which serves the decoding requests from edge
device directly, and the edge-only inference system which generates
all tokens locally on the devices across various metrics including
throughput, system capacity, cost efficiency, and impact of speculative length on system capacity and the throughput.
To accurately simulate verification request workloads from edge
devices utilizing speculative decoding, we adopt a Poisson-based
modeling approach. Each edge device is considered an independent
source of verification requests, with inter-arrival times following an
exponential distribution. This modeling choice effectively captures
the asynchronous and inherently stochastic nature of real-world
device interactions, ensuring that the simulated workload closely
mirrors realistic operational conditions. The device-specific request
rate is derived directly from realistic device speculative decoding throughput, ensuring that the simulation’s temporal patterns
closely align with practical speculative decoding workloads.
As for the device setting, we tested Raspberry Pi 4b, 5 and
NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano on the SLED system supported by 4
A100 GPUs. We deployed LLaMA family, including model sizes of
1B, 3B, 11B and 70B on the edge devices and verification server,
supporting up to context length of 128k.
4.1 Whole System Token Generation Rate
(WSTGR)
We first evaluate the Whole System Token Generation Rate (WSTGR),
which is defined as the total number of tokens generated and verified by the entire inference system per second, and serves as a metric
for the system’s overall productive output[18]. Given a certain time
period we measure the total number of tokens generated by the
SLED and centralized inference system. The verification workload
model is derived from a Raspberry Pi 5 device running a LLaMA
3B model. Additionally, we evaluate two different target models
(11B and 70B) on both the SLED system and a centralized inference
system. As shown in Fig. 4, for both the 11B and 70B models, the
WSTGR increases rapidly in the initial stages as batch size grows,
SEC ’25, December 3–6, 2025, Arlington, VA, USA Li et al.
Figure 5: The Impact of speculative length on system-level
capacity and device-level throughput, showing the speculative length should be considered to balance the tradeoff.
due to the amortization of fixed GPU launch and driver overhead,
and improved utilization of GPU cores. The proposed SLED system
achieves higher overall throughput than the centralized serving
system under identical conditions, including the same number of
devices and target model. This observed scalability demonstrates
that SLED effectively utilizes distributed edge resources to enhance
the system’s token generation capacity.
The more than twofold improvement in WSTGR over the centralized serving system stems from the efficient and balanced distribution of computational tasks in the SLED system. Specifically,
in SLED, simple token generation tasks can be handled by relatively small models [15], such as those deployed on edge devices,
while more complex tasks are offloaded to larger models on the
edge server. This architectural separation allows computation to
be distributed across edge devices and the edge server in a more
resource-aligned and efficient manner. As a result, the computational capacity of the edge server is reserved for challenging verification tasks, rather than being consumed by processing simpler
tokens from edge devices, unlike in a centralized LLM serving setup.
4.2 Speculative Length vs. throughput and
capacity
In speculative decoding, the length of the draft sequence used for
verification on the target model is defined as the speculative length,
and it affects both token generation throughput and the capacity
of SLED, that is, the number of edge devices supported by SLED
simultaneously. In this experiment, we manually adjust the speculative length for drafting using LLaMA 1B model on a Raspberry Pi
5 device, and measure both the device throughput and overall system capacity. As shown in Fig. 5, increasing the speculative length
results in lower device throughput but higher system capacity. This
inverse relationship between per-device and system-level metrics
highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate speculative
length to balance the performance of individual edge devices and
the system as a whole. On one hand, a longer speculative length
reduces token generation on each device, since the drafting throughput remains stable, and a longer speculative length leads to a longer
verification period, thereby reducing the response update rate. On
the other hand, a longer verification period for individual devices
Figure 6: Pareto front showing optimal trade-offs between
energy consumption per token and latency, highlighting the
efficiency of SLED.
reduces the verification workload on the edge server, allowing it to
support more devices concurrently.
4.3 Cost Efficiency and System Throughput
The cost efficiency of token generation in edge computing scenarios is a critical factor and has been considered in various edge
inference system designs [12, 13]. In this paper, we compare the
proposed SLED system, a centralized serving system, and an alledge decoding system in terms of both cost efficiency and WSTGR.
To systematically analyze the trade-off between cost and performance, we construct Pareto front visualizations, which highlight
the non-dominated configurations that achieve the best balance
between monetary cost and system throughput.
In our experiments, the cost and throughput metrics for edge
inference scenarios were carefully computed based on a comprehensive capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) model[25]. Specifically, we adopt the widely recognized CPU-hour cost model described by Walker[25] and the edgecompute modeling approach proposed by Eriksson[6]. The CAPEX
component was determined by amortizing the purchase price of
each edge device (Raspberry Pi 5 priced at $80 [24]) over a threeyear lifetime, assuming an average device utilization rate of 70%.
The OPEX component included electrical consumption calculated
from experimentally measured average power draw (8 W for Pi 5)
[20] and industrial electricity rates (0.083 $/kWh) [5]. Combining
these costs, we obtained a unified hourly expense for each device,
subsequently normalized by the experimentally measured token
generation rates (tokens per second), as shown in Eq. 3. The resulting metric, expressed clearly as dollars per one thousand generated
tokens ($/1K tokens), enabled direct and transparent comparison
across different experimental configurations and devices.

Figure 6 compares the following three deployment strategies
along a common cost–performance plane. Specifically, the strategies are: 1) all-Server executes every token-generation step on a
bank of four NVIDIA A100–80 GB GPUs. 2) All-Edge places the
same LLaMA draft model on each Raspberry Pi 5, with no server
involvement. 3) SLED lets the Raspberry Pi 5 generate draft tokens,
which are batch-verified on the A100 cluster with the same configuration of the centralized scenario. For every strategy, we sweep two
orthogonal factors: quantization precision (16-, 8-, and 4-bit) and
edge-device count 𝑁 ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. Cost is monetised as dollars
per one-thousand verified tokens.
We observe that SLED’s skyline consistently dominates the Pareto
frontier, achieving lower cost per 1K verified tokens while sustaining higher overall throughput. For instance, with the same system
capacity and quantization level, SLED achieves a throughput of 137
tokens/s—representing a 3.5× improvement over the centralized
baseline—while simultaneously reducing cost to just 29% of that.
This advantage becomes more pronounced as the number of edge
devices increases. Furthermore, quantization universally improves
cost efficiency across all schemes by simultaneously reducing energy demand and increasing per-device generation rate. Notably,
the 4-bit SLED configuration with 16 devices achieves 137 tokens/s
at $0.13 / 1K tokens, representing a 65% improvement in throughput
over the best-performing All-Edge setup, with acceptable additional
cost. These results substantiate the claim that SLED enables a superior cost–throughput trade-off, combining local cost efficiency
with global throughput.
4.4 Impacts of Network Connectivity
We built a SLED prototype to quantify how network loss affects
edge-side throughput. The edge runs on a Raspberry Pi 5B hosting meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct for drafting, while the server
uses A100 GPU running meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
for batched verification. We instrumented the system to sweep
packet-loss ratios from 0% to 100% under a fixed RTT budget and
measured the committed token throughput at the edge. As shown
in Fig.7, across commonly used settings in practice (≤5–10% loss),
SLED’s edge throughput degraded only slightly (typically <2–3%
versus the no-loss baseline), confirming that the proposed retrythen-fallback policy effectively masks moderate loss. Even under
complete network unavailability (responses never arrive), the edge
maintained ≥5.24 tokens/s, comfortably above typical human reading rates, ensuring responsive user-perceived progress. These results indicate that, in both engineering practice and research deployments, SLED preserves acceptable edge throughput under realistic
packet-loss regimes, while providing graceful performance under
extreme conditions.
Additionally, we evaluated the response quality of the SLED under varying packet loss rates in the prototype system. By sweeping
the packet loss ratio from 0% to 100%, we assessed performance on
GSM8K [3], a curated benchmark of linguistically diverse, gradeschool math word problems designed to evaluate multi-step quantitative reasoning in language models. As shown in Fig.8, the response quality remains consistent with that of the target model
when the verification packet loss rate is below 10%, which covers
the most common real-world conditions. The quality gradually

throughput.
Figure 8: The impact of packet loss on the quality of generated response.
declines to the draft model level as the packet loss rate increases
from 10% to 100%, indicating a loss of connection to the verification
server. Based on the proposed retry-then-fallback policy, persistent
packet loss triggers a fallback to the local draft model for token
generation, leading to a degradation in output quality. These results
demonstrate that under typical connectivity conditions, SLED can
effectively serve edge devices without compromising accuracy.
Overall, the experimental evaluations underscore the significant
advantages of SLED in distributed inference scenarios, including
throughput, capacity, and cost efficiency, showcasing insightful
findings in the SLED system to motivate more explorations in future
work.

drafting and centralized verification establishes a balance of computational workload, making SLED particularly suitable for bringing
LLMs towards the edge of the network. The position paper highlights that the SLED is more than a decoding enhancement—it opens
the door to a more foundational and elastic approach to resourceaware LLM serving at the edge.
In future work, we will explore optimizing key–value caching
strategies, potentially leveraging recent advances in PagedAttention, to further reduce server-side verification cost. Additionally,
enhancing the adaptive capabilities of SLED for dynamic environments, such as extending SLED’s applicability to multi-modal scenarios, will be another interesting topic to focus on. Lastly, network
conditions and resource-aware verification strategy could further
broaden its practical impact in complex edge computing landscapes.
